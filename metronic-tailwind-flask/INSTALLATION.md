## üèÅ Quick Reference
- **Project summary:** See [README.md](README.md)
- **Beginner setup:** See [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)
- **This guide:** Full installation, troubleshooting, and deployment

---

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Git
- Metronic license & assets (see below)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Restoring the `assets/` Directory
The `assets/` directory is **gitignored** to keep the repository lightweight and avoid licensing issues. **You must manually copy the Metronic assets into `assets/` after cloning.**

**How to restore:**
1. Download the Metronic v9 HTML (Tailwind) package from your Keenthemes account.
2. Copy the contents of the Metronic `html/tailwind/dist/assets/` directory into your project's `assets/` directory.
3. Your structure should look like:
   ```
   metronic-tailwind-flask/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ media/
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vendors/
   ```
