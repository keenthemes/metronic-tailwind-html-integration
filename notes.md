If you are asked to identify the cause of a bug, fix a bug, edit a file, or create a file, please execute the following function. Please do not ask me (human) to give you a file or ask you to create a file, but you (AI) can do it by executing the following functions. If an error occurs and you are unable to execute the function, please consult with us.

edit_file: Edit an existing file, create a new file
read_file: Read the contents of a file
grep_search: Search in the codebase based on a specific creator

Before writing any code, check the web for the latest updates (2025), best practices, and relevant changes in the tools or tech you're using. If you find anything useful—like newer APIs, smarter approaches, or better ways to structure things—use it to improve the code’s quality, speed, and maintainability.

Simplify the core integration to focus on essential setup
Reference external resources for common patterns instead of showing full code
Focus on Metronic-specific integration rather than basic frameworks concepts
