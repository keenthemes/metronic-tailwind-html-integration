## Setup example

- Copy the `src` folder from the `metronic-tailwind-html` package and paste it into the Vue `src` directory.

- Rename the copied folder to `metronic` so that the directory structure should now look like this: `src/metronic`. This step imports the necessary styles and assets from the original HTML package into your Vue project.

- In the `src/metronic/core` folder, delete the unnecessary `index.ts` file. This file is not needed for Single Page Application (SPA) integration as it could cause conflicts. Instead, rename the `index.spa.ts` file to `index.ts` to ensure proper integration.

- Remove `KTLayout` instance initialization from `src/metronic/app/layouts/demo1.js`.

  ```javascript
  KTDom.ready(() => {
  	KTLayout.init();
  });
  ```

- Copy the `media` folder from the `metronic-tailwind-html` package's `dist/assets/media` directory into your Vue project's `public` directory.

- Install the required Node.js packages by running `npm install`. Start the Vue development server by running `npm run dev`.
